Women typically seek PDO thread procedures for facial rejuvenation, such as lifting sagging skin, improving skin texture, and reducing wrinkles. The demand is driven by women’s growing interest in non-invasive cosmetic treatments that offer visible, long-lasting results without the need for surgical intervention. PDO threads are frequently used around the face, neck, and jawline to enhance contours and restore a youthful appearance. With increasing awareness of these treatments, many women are opting for PDO threads as an alternative to facelifts, making it an increasingly popular choice in the market.The application of PDO threads in women also benefits from the trend toward personalized aesthetics, with treatments being tailored to individual needs, preferences, and desired outcomes. For example, some women may opt for PDO threads to address specific concerns such as fine lines, volume loss, or skin sagging, while others may use them as a preventative measure to delay the visible signs of aging. As a result, PDO threads are emerging as a versatile solution for a wide range of aesthetic goals, attracting a growing number of female patients who value both the effectiveness and convenience of this non-surgical procedure.
